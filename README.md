#### i’m currently working on **[pronouns.js](/katacarbix/pronouns.js)**.
it's a node module that can understand users' pronouns and lets you use them in sentences. try out the demo [here](https://katacarbix.github.io/pronouns.js/demo/index.html)!

#### i’m looking for help with funding.
i'll be honest, being deaf, disabled, trans, and with little work experience makes it hard to find a job that both accommodates my needs and allows me to do what i enjoy. plus, the 2020 pandemic and bureaucracy in general makes government assistance incredibly difficult and slow to obtain. i'm thankful for my parents helping me out for the time being, but i would like to be able to live on my own and have more freedom.

i have a [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/reeseovine) where you can make a one-time donation, and i'm also working on getting my GitHub Sponsors page set up.
